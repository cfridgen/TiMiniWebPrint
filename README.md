# TiMini Print Bluetooth Printer Tool
Alternative [desktop software for Chinese Bluetooth thermal printers](https://github.com/Dejniel/TiMini-Print/releases) that use proprietary protocols (not ESC/POS), as a replacement for apps like “Tiny Print”, “Fun Print”, “Phomemo”, or “iBleem”.
It supports almost all mini printers! Check the huge list of [supported Bluetooth printer models](#supported-printer-models), or report missing ones.
It lets you print images, PDFs, or plain text from your computer. It supports a web app and a “fire-and-forget” CLI mode, plus [custom integrations](#library-integration).

These printers are often sold on AliExpress and under generic names such as “thermal printer”, “mini printer”, or “cat printer”.
TiMini Print works on Windows, Linux, and macOS as a standalone tool without a system printer driver (it does not emulate a driver or print spooler)

## Motivation
I bought a Chinese mini printer and could not find any decent desktop software that met my expectations, so I wrote my own. This is also the kind of work I do professionally. If you need help with a similar problem, you can [contact me](https://inajiffy.eu/) — I can also help with [broader support or custom implementation](#looking-for-broader-support-or-implementation)

# We need you!
- This project is open source! Your small monthly support on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dejniel) can make a real difference and help keep it going—even a one-time donation helps. Building and maintaining a project like this takes a lot of time; if you find it useful, please consider supporting it so I can keep improving it: [support the project](https://buymeacoffee.com/dejniel)
- If you're a developer, contributions and bug reports are always welcome—please jump in. Especially if you use or build on non-Linux systems, please consider contributing fixes or improvements

## Looking for broader support or implementation?
- If you need security/reverse engineering, broader commercial support, or a custom implementation, feel free to [reach out](https://inajiffy.eu/). I work on broken systems, neglected integrations, and projects that are already end-of-life, unsupported — or simply unsupportable. I also handle custom implementation work that sits outside the usual support model

# Requirements
You can find the latest standalone executable files on the [releases page](https://github.com/Dejniel/TiMini-Print/releases) and choose the asset that starts with `TiMini-Print-Command-Line-...` for your platform, or you can build the project yourself

Theoretically, I support Windows, macOS, and Linux, but I test builds only on Ubuntu-like systems—if you need to run this elsewhere, please report issues or submit a fix :P

## Manual building requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: Windows + Python 3.13+: installing `winsdk` may require building binaries during download)
# Quick start
If you use release binaries, run the downloaded executable directly.
If you build or run from source instead, use `python3 timiniprint_web.py` or `python3 timiniprint_command_line.py`.

## Web app
Start the web app from source:

```bash
python3 timiniprint_web.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## Command line interface
(the examples use Linux filenames)
- Print to the first supported Bluetooth printer:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print to a specific Bluetooth printer:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --bluetooth "PRINTER_NAME" /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print via a serial port (skip Bluetooth connection):
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --bluetooth "PRINTER_NAME" --export-device-config printer.json
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --serial /dev/rfcomm0 --device-config printer.json /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print raw text without creating a file:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --text "Hello from CLI"
  ```

- List available printer profiles:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --list-profiles
  ```

- Scan for supported printers:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --scan
  ```

## Notes
- If `--bluetooth` is omitted, the first supported printer found is used
- For `--serial`, you must pass `--device-config`
- `--export-device-config` writes the full resolved runtime config as JSON and `--device-config` loads that JSON back and forces the saved protocol/profile/runtime values

# Notes
- On first Classic connection on Windows/macOS, the system may request pairing confirmation

## Library integration
If you want to build your own integration instead of using only the bundled web app or CLI, start with [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md). It is the practical first-steps guide to creating a `PrinterDevice`, building a printable job, and sending it through a connector from your own code. If you also want the package boundaries and design rationale behind that API, continue with [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
